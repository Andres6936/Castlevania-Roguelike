The halls, the castle lab, and also the Dark forest (which is my favorite stage - wouldn't mind if that'd be bigger ;-))

Okay, looks like that having Estoc wasn't enough, after all... Still, this is the farthest I got since all playtest vesrions :-)

I really like the graphics - even though I play only in console, but I love the day and night ;-) - and also the new sound effects and music, and also new skills and abilities that each class has (though I have only just sampled a few...). And a real and catchy storyline! I only wish I could get farther.

For discussion: I know I have been complaining about rooms being too big ;-) Now, however, they seem to me to be too small. What about rooms size being something in-between the old layout and the new one?

Also, I would prefer having more weaker monsters around than few stronger ones that can ditch the player in three strokes. If swarmed by a throng of monsters, player can pay more attention to the strategy - where to step, what powers or items to use, etc. I think it would add to the gameplay, though it would shift CvRL more toward Diablo-like hack'n'slash... What do other players say?
