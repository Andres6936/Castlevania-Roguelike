On my way to the town of Petra, I found a lone adventurer who asked me to pick him up; on the path he told me about the perils that were coming down into the world, and his obligations to meet his fate at the castle of Dracula; I told him nothing was happening, that I had been to Petra two months ago and everything was peaceful there, and that I was just going to pickup two wealthy passengers. I told him that such castle no longer existed, and only a marshland of ruins stood were it once was. But I was wrong, the air was different, the moon was bloody. Vicious bats flew down from the dark clouds and unholy panthers were running behind us. The Stranger didn't seem surprised, and dispatched them with mystical conjurations. The forest, darker than usual, contorted and convulted, and my charriot was blown to pieces. We were there, in the dark night, a few miles away from both the castle and the town, trapped inside the forest, my knee hurt deeply. I shall await here, I shall hope the stranger suceeds and the maladies over this world dissapear, for now I will just wait here.
