After few more attempts playing with Manbeast, I have to say that I fear it's coming dangerously close to the PCM challenge in Drash (i.e. nearly impossible). See my mortem:

Observations:

- Unarmed & unarmored combat probably doesn't bring Manbeast any positive effects compared to other classes. It takes 2 hits to take down a single bat, and the bat can reduce Manbeast's health by quite a lot (5 HP).

- Combat gauntlets have no noticeable effect either. I managed to find silver combat gauntlets with atk 14, and still it took me 2 hits to take down a single bat... I was doing better with a baselard (atk 1).

- The only option how to make unarmed combat work is to use the powers, but they are very costly - 3 hearts, and Power blow doesn't last long enough to make it worthwhile (To see what I mean, compare this to Invoker's dove egg, with which I can take down 3 wargs in one hit for just 1 heart, well, you get the picture ;-)). The heart capacity of Manbeast unfortunately isn't high enough for this strategy to last long.

- The cost of throwing weapons needs to be lowered considerably. Really. One stack of 8 simple throwing knives costs 2000gp, and as it takes 2 hits to take down an ape skeleton with throwing knives, this gives you the cost of 250gp per ape skeleton. Compare this with 50gp price reload for a simple bow which has the same effect, and you still have the knives 5-times more costly. IMHO the cost of throwing weapons should be lowered to its 1.25 levels to make them worth the while (at least it would prevent some amusing paradoxes, like Manbeast who is "very poor" starting with 11 stack of knives = 22000gp in total, which is quite a fortune ;-)).

So it seems that the only option for Manbeast right now is to fight armed to the teeth with swords & bows (with the only handicap that he cannot wear better armor than studded leather)... which is just not the Manbeast way... Manbeast was my favorite class in 1.25, and I would really like to finish the game with him one day, but currently, that seems nigh impossible... :-(
